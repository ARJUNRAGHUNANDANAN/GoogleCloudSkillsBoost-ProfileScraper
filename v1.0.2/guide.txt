Help Guide for GoogleCloudSkillsBoost-ProfileScraper V1.0.2

I put away the intermediate V1.0.1 script since It didnt feel like an improvement. 
Version V1.0.2 was extremely useful in tracking whether a large number of students completed a Specific list of Cloud Skills Boost Badge. 

- This is the 2nd iteration of code. 
- This update aims to tackle a nested loop to take multiple Skills Boost Public Profile. 
- This in intended for use offline by Facilitators or event cordinators when they need to fetch participants progress in bulk and hence should not be used maliciously. 
- Please ensure that you do not reupload modified code with filled csv in them which may cause user data leaks. 
- This script or method is not tested or optimized  for large datasets as my usecase was within 100-200 participants.

Usage 
- Facilitators who receive the daily reports in the format of the file in this directory "daily-report.csv" can add the path to this directory in the code.
- This code does not allow individual submitting individual public profiles the way V1.0.0 allowed although I plan to make some option for it.
- Logs and Results are also generated by script but you need to manually create a output.txt or result.txt in the rootfolder. (code will break otherwise since It cannot find the file)

Planned Improvements
- A structured Output layout has not been decided. Currently it generated a lot of unstuctured logs & terminal outputs. (Maybe I need to look into JSON like Structure, I am still learning this)
- Intermediate Data Cacheing to prevent fetching from website everytime unless needed. (SQLite Database is an option. Need to investigate. I will do this once I finish my "Using Databases with Python" course on Coursera)
- No UI Based application has been developed for this. (I may attempt this once I learn DJango, Streamlit or any similar ways to host and manage a UI based app)
- Code breaking due to file not being present needs to be fixed. Consequences of appending to and overwriting existing files needs to be studied. 
- I need to see if I can do anything to reduce load on Qwiklabs side when sending 100s of page request in small time. I dont want to get banned or anything.
