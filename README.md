## Introduction

This Python script is designed to extract the names of badges from a public profile HTML page on Qwiklabs. It uses the Beautiful Soup library to parse the HTML and extract the badge names from specific elements. It's a simple tool that can be useful for individuals interested in organizing and summarizing their achievements on Qwiklabs. I currently have not planned to keep any live hosted demos for this. 

## Motivation

I made this script during 2023 October Cloud Study Jam to make it easier to keep track of completions and also assist group member. I also wanted to practice my Web Scraping Skills that I recently studied via coursera

## Licenses 

I have no plans regarding this. This project is released with no specific license.

I would love to see if you star the project or credit me if you use the code. 

Using the script for malicious web scraping should not be done and I do not take  responsibility for any malicious bulk web scraping.
